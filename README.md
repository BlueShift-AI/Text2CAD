The aim is to create an application which can generate parametric computer aided design output such as STL or SCAD.  Version two will implement a RAG network for containing multiple CAD files.

Instructions:

  1. Install ollama.
  2. Pull model into ollama.
  3. Edit the model in python source.
  4. Run python script.

ToDo:

  1. Finetune dedicated CAD based LLM for use with ollama.

This is still in development.
